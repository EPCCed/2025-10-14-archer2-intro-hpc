## General Information

This lesson is an introduction to using high-performance computing systems
effectively. We obviously can't cover every case or give an exhaustive course
on parallel programming in just one lesson of teaching time. Instead, this
lesson is intended to give students a good introduction and overview of the
tools available and how to use them effectively.

::: keypoints

By the end of this lesson, students will know how to:

- Identify problems an HPC system can help solve
- Use the UNIX shell (also known as terminal or command line) to operate a
  computer, connect to an HPC system, and write simple shell scripts.
- Submit and manage jobs on an HPC system using a scheduler, transfer files,
  and use software through environment modules.

::: prereq

To begin this lesson you must have completed the following:

 * Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating 
   system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they can download and run 
   a terminal application on. Alternatively, they should have a few specific software 
   packages installed (listed in the Setup section below). 
 * Participants must agree to abide by the ARCHER2 [Code of Conduct](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/about/policies/code-of-conduct) 
 * Attendees should be familair with using the bash shell. This is covered in the [Introduction to the Shell HPC course](https://epcced.github.io/2024-06-19-hpc-shell-shampton/)
 * Complete the software/system setup including how to connection to ARCHER2 via [SSH](#connect-to-archer2).
